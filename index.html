    <h2>About Me:</h2>
    <p>
        Hi! My name is Noah Schenk and I am a recent grad of Indiana University. I have received my Master's in Secure Computing and have also received my Bachelor's in Computer Science with a focus in security and a minor in mathematics. 
    </p>

        I have been coding since I was a freshman in high school and since then have gained proficiency in a large variety of coding languages. I started coding in java and learned html and css, then taught myself python and took an artificial intelligence class based in python. I also took a low-level coding class where I learned C and learned how to read and reverse engineer machine code. Knowing that I had a lot of projects that were not able to be easily accessed, I taught myself javascript and ported my most interesting projects over onto this website.
