		<h1>About Me:</h1>
		<p>
			Hi! My name is Noah Schenk and I am a computer science major at Indiana University
			specializing in security. I am also pursuing an accelerated masters in secure computing and a minor in mathematics.
		</p>
		<p>
			I have been coding since I was a freshman in high school and since then have gained proficiency in a large variety of coding languages. I started
			coding in java and learned html and css, then taught myself python and took an artificial intelligence class based in python. I also took a low-level
			coding class where I learned C and learned how to read and reverse engineer machine code. Knowing that I had a lot of projects that were not able to
			be easily accessed, I taught myself javascript and ported my most interesting projects over onto this website.
