          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            Hi there! I'm a passionate computer science student with a strong focus on security, currently pursuing my Master's degree in Secure Computing at Indiana University. I completed my undergraduate studies at IU from 2020 to 2023, where I earned a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout my journey at Indiana University, I've had the opportunity to explore various programming languages, including C, Java, and Python. As you browse through this website, you'll find a collection of projects that I've worked on, showcasing my skills and creativity. I initially developed many of these projects in different languages and later adapted them to JavaScript using the p5.js canvas library, allowing me to seamlessly present them here.
          </p>
          <p>
            Around half of the projects featured on this website were completed as part of my coursework, while the other half were personal projects driven by my curiosity and passion. One particular project that I'm immensely proud of is the Nomograms Solver. It started as a personal interest and allowed me to showcase my algorithm design skills. However, please note that the projects featured here represent just a selection of the more visually captivating works. I've also undertaken numerous projects with a strong focus on security, which may not have flashy end results but are nonetheless intellectually stimulating and centered on enhancing security measures.
